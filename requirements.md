# Requirements

The requirements for development are quite simple.
Experienced developers that are already using
Docker Compose and PHP Composer can skip this section.

First, make sure that all needed components are installed.

* [Get Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) – Dependency Manager for PHP

* Check Composer version

  `composer --version`
