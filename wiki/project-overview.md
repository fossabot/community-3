# Project Overview

## Welcome to PandaWiki[¬∂](project-overview.md#welcome-to-pandawiki) <a id="welcome-to-pandawiki"></a>

> [‚û° Deutschsprachige Beschreibung](https://pandainfo.github.io/community/wiki/Home/Startseite)

This is the project space of üêæ **association panda!** in Vienna.

### Overview[¬∂](project-overview.md#overview) <a id="overview"></a>

Together with the bookshop [Librer√≠a Utop√≠a](https://radicalbookstore.com/) we are currently working on our panda platform.

There you will soon find book recommendations, events, podcasts, a digital shop, and more.

This wiki is being used to coordinate our research and development. Primary language in this wiki is German, while we aim to translate everything into English asap.

At the moment, the first purpose of this wiki is the creation of our [SRS document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification).

### Contributing[¬∂](project-overview.md#contributing) <a id="contributing"></a>

Welcome to team panda! We love contributions and new team members. In case you are contributing to this project for the first time, it would be nice if you could briefly introduce yourself, telling us about your interest in the project and related experiences.

Please note that like other projects we have a [Code of Conduct](https://pandainfo.github.io/community/wiki/Home/Code-of-Conduct), comparable to the old days' \[Netiquette\]. We kindly ask you to read these community standards carefully and to follow it in in every interaction with this project, its team members, and our contributors.
