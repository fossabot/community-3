# Versioning

## Versioning[Â¶](versioning.md#versioning) <a id="versioning"></a>

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/pandainfo/panda/tags).

As this project depends on upstream, only patch level changes will be adopted, marked by the keyword `panda` followed by the internal patch version.

Major and minor version numbers should only be increased to highlight an external update, i.e. when upgrading to a higher upstream release.

 Last update: January 24, 2021
